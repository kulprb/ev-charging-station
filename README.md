# EV Charging Station Web Application

## Overview

This project is a web-based application designed for **electric vehicle (EV) users** to locate charging stations and for **EV station owners** to register their stations. The system allows users to view available slots, book a time, and receive information on the nearest charging points through an interactive map interface.

## Features

1. **User Registration and Login**: 
   - Allows both **EV owners** and **charging station owners** to register and log in to the platform.
   - User details, including first name, email, and station information (if applicable), are securely stored.

2. **EV Station Registration**:
   - Charging station owners can register their stations by providing details such as the station's location and available slots.
   - Stations are then displayed on an interactive map for EV users to access.

3. **Slot Booking**:
   - Users can book a slot at a registered charging station for a specific date and time.
   - The system ensures that slots are available and updates in real-time to prevent double bookings.

4. **Map Integration**:
   - The system includes a dynamic map, displaying all registered EV charging stations.
   - Users can click on map markers to view station details and proceed with slot booking.

5. **Data Storage and Management**:
   - User information, booking data, and station details are stored in a **MongoDB** database.
   - The system ensures that data is secure and efficiently managed.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Map API**: (OpenStreetMap, leaflet.js)
